# BusMall

Three images are displayed on the screen for the user to vote on.
The user will vote 25 times on different combinations of products.
The data will be compiled in a chart so the research team can see clearly which items are most popular based on percent of time the item was chosen.


For reference I used the lectures, jshint.com (to check for missing symbols), MDN, and the Duckett Text Books, and http://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/
I heavily used the structure from the lab demonstrated in class, but wrote my own code.
